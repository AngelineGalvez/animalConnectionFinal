<p>About Us</p>
</div>

<div class="history">
<p>The Animal Connection was established in 1987, and is San Francisco's largest and independent pet store. We are not your typical pet shop. To us, each pet is unique and is family, so we strive to find the perfect fit between the owners and their pets. Our staff is experienced, knowledgeable, and extremely passionate about animals.</p>

<div class="specialties">
	<p><b>Specialties</b></p>
	<p>We carry premium and progressive dog and cat diets. We also offer a huge selection of dog & cat toys and supplies. Our high quality live and frozen foods for reptiles, amphibians and fish are readily available and fairly priced! We carry the largest selection of exotic birds in San Francisco. Grab some top of the line cages, accessories and toys to spoil your feathered friend! We offer name brand pelleted foods as well as bulk and packaged seeds. We have rescued and responsibly bred guinea pigs, rats, and hamsters as well as cages supplies and behavioral enrichment items for when you take home your new hamsters, rats, guinea pigs, or chinchillas! We have rescued and responsibly bred reptiles including, but not limited to, leopard geckos, crested geckos, bearded dragons, veiled chameleons, and corn and king snakes</p>

<div class="pThree">
	<p><b>Our Animals</b></p>
	<p>Animal welfare is a great concern of ours. If you're thinking about taking home a pet, our expert staff will pair you up with the right animal for you! We do NOT sell dogs, cats, and rabbit and always suggest adoption. These are the top three animals that occupy shelters! We also carry premium pet supplies to keep your pet happy and healthy. We do not support breeding mills! All of our animals are from hand selected breeders that take care of their animals or are rescued animals that have been surrendered. Support rescue and responsible breeding by going to The Animal Connection!</p>
